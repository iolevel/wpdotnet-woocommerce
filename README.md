# WooCommerce for .NET

This project builds WooCommerce from sources to .NET. It can be used as a dependency by regular ASP.NET Core application and self-hosted.

## Background

First, we have created project called [WpDotNet](https://github.com/iolevel/wpdotnet-sdk) - WpDotNet is entire [WordPress](https://wordpress.org/download/) compiled to .NET `.dll` using the [PeachPie](https://peachpie.io) - the PHP to .NET Compiler. In addition it provides a few APIs written purely in C# to add _WordPress_ as a [middleware](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/middleware/?view=aspnetcore-8.0) to new or existing ASP.NET Core application.

Once there is WordPress as a .NET assembly, with all the functions and classes compiled in a strongly typed metadata, we wraped it in a NuGet package, and using this as a dependency we can build WordPress plugins separately as .NET assemblies as well.

See [PeachPie](https://www.peachpie.io/) for more details, and consider supporting us on [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/pchpcompiler) ðŸ˜Š

## Sample App

See the `app` folder with minimal ASP.NET Core application. It references WpDotNet package and WooCommerce project.

The sample app requires you to start MySql by yourself, port 3306, having database `wordpress`.

- `global.json`

    Versions of [PeachPie](https://peachpie.io) and [WpDotNet](https://github.com/iolevel/wpdotnet-sdk) used for compilation. Versions need to correspond to each other.
